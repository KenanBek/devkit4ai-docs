Developer keys authenticate console actions and Starter Kit deployments that need elevated access. You can create multiple keys for different environments, applications, or team members.

(((REPLACE_THIS_WITH_IMAGE: console-developer-keys-overview.png: Cloud Admin developer keys management page showing list of keys)))

## Key Format

Developer Keys use the following format:

**Prefix:** `ak_` (API Key)

**Full format:** `ak_` + 32 URL-safe characters (alphanumeric + `-` + `_`)

**Example:** `ak_abc123XYZ-_789def456ghi012jkl345`

**Total length:** 35 characters (3 character prefix + 32 character key)

<Note>
Developer keys previously used the `dk_` prefix. The new `ak_` prefix was introduced in v1.5.0 to better reflect their purpose as API authentication keys.
</Note>

## Key Properties

- **Hashing:** Keys are hashed with SHA-256 before storage for security
- **Prefix storage:** Only the first 8 characters (e.g., `dk_abc12`) are stored in `key_prefix` for identification
- **One-time display:** The full key is shown once during generation; only the hash is persisted
- **Developer scoping:** Each key is bound to a specific developer account via `developer_id`
- **Active status:** Keys can be revoked by setting `is_active` to false

## Managing Developer Keys

### Accessing the Developer Keys Page

Navigate to **Developer Keys** from the Cloud Admin console sidebar:

1. Log in to Cloud Admin at [devkit4ai.com/console](https://devkit4ai.com/console) or [vibecoding.ad/console](https://vibecoding.ad/console)
2. Click **Developer Keys** in the left sidebar
3. View your existing keys and their usage statistics

### Creating a New Developer Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Generation Dialog">
    Click the **Generate Key** button in the top right corner
  <Key Management Actions

### Viewing Key Details

Each key in the list displays:
- **Name**: Descriptive label you provided
- **Key Prefix**: First 8 characters (e.g., `ak_abc12`) for identification
- **Created**: When the key was generated
- **Last Used**: Most recent authentication timestamp (or "Never used")
- **Actions**: Revoke button

### Revoking a Developer Key

<WaUse Cases

### Local Development

Use a development-specific key for local testing:

```bash
# .env.local
DEVKIT4AI_DEVELOPER_KEY=ak_dev_environment_key_here
```

### CI/CD Pipelines

Create a dedicated key for automated deployments:

```bash
# GitHub Actions Secret
DEVKIT4AI_DEVELOPER_KEY=ak_cicd_pipeline_key_here
```

### Team Member Access

Issue individual keys for team members working with the API:

- **Frontend Developer**: Key for Starter Kit development
- **Backend Developer**: Key for API integration testing
- **DevOps Engineer**: Key for deployment automation

### Multi-Environment Setup

Separate keys for each environment:

```bash
# Production
DEVKIT4AI_DEVELOPER_KEY=ak_production_key_here

# Staging
DEVKIT4AI_DEVELOPER_KEY=ak_staging_key_here

# Development
DEVKIT4AI_DEVELOPER_KEY=ak_development_key_here
```

To revoke a key:

1. Locate the key in the Developer Keys list
2. Click the **Revoke** button in the Actions column
3. Confirm the revocation in the dialog
4. The key is immediately deactivated

<Tip>
Before revoking a key, check the **Last Used** timestamp to ensure it's not actively in use.
</Tip>

## Key Limits

Each developer account is limited to **10 active keys** at a time. 

When you reach the limit:
- The **Generate Key** button displays "Limit Reached (10/10)"
- Revoke unused keys before creating new ones
- Consider which keys are no longer needed by checking last usage dates

(((REPLACE_THIS_WITH_IMAGE: console-developer-keys-limit-reached.png: Generate button disabled with limit message)))

### Managing Key Limits

Best practices for staying within limits:

1. **Regular Audits**: Review your keys monthly and revoke unused ones
2. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear names to identify key purposes
3. **Environment-Based**: Use one key per environment (dev, staging, prod)
4. **Application-Based**: Separate keys for different applications or services
5. **Team Member Keys**: Individual keys for team members who need API access
    Enter a descriptive name like "Production API" or "Staging Environment" to help identify the key's purpose
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate and Copy">
    Click **Generate** and immediately copy the full key. **This is your only chance to see the complete key!**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Store Securely">
    Save the key in your environment variables or secret management system
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Environment Variable

In your Starter Kit or Cloud Admin deployment, set the generated key as:

```bash
DEVKIT4AI_DEVELOPER_KEY=ak_abc123XYZ-_789def456ghi012jkl345
```

## Generation Flow

1. Cloud Admin UI calls `POST /api/v1/auth/developer-keys` with optional `name` parameter
2. Backend generates key with `ak_` prefix and 32 random URL-safe characters
3. Full key is hashed with SHA-256
4. Hash and prefix (first 8 chars) are stored in the database
5. Full key is returned in response and displayed once
6. Key becomes valid immediately for API requests

## Rate Limits

Each developer account is limited to **10 active keys** at a time. Revoke unused keys before generating new ones if you reach this limit.

## Security

<Warning>
- Store the full key securely - it cannot be retrieved again
- Never commit keys to version control
- Rotate keys regularly (every 90 days recommended)
- Revoke compromised keys immediately
</Warning>
