Developer keys authenticate console actions and Starter Kit deployments that need elevated access:

- Keys are hashed with SHA-256 in the database, matching the implementation in `devkit4ai/backend-api/app/features/projects`.
- Cloud Admin will expose creation flows that call the existing command handlers; until then, you can create keys via the `/api/v1/auth/developer-keys` endpoint, which already returns the full key once.
- Each key is prefixed with `dk_`—the same format used throughout the platform and referenced in onboarding screens.
