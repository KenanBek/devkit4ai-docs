Developer keys authenticate console actions and Starter Kit deployments that need elevated access.

## Key Format

Developer Keys use the following format:

**Prefix:** `dk_` (Developer Key)

**Full format:** `dk_` + 32 URL-safe characters (alphanumeric + `-` + `_`)

**Example:** `dk_abc123XYZ-_789def456ghi012jkl345`

**Total length:** 35 characters (3 character prefix + 32 character key)

## Key Properties

- **Hashing:** Keys are hashed with SHA-256 before storage for security
- **Prefix storage:** Only the first 8 characters (e.g., `dk_abc12`) are stored in `key_prefix` for identification
- **One-time display:** The full key is shown once during generation; only the hash is persisted
- **Developer scoping:** Each key is bound to a specific developer account via `developer_id`
- **Active status:** Keys can be revoked by setting `is_active` to false

## Environment Variable

In your Starter Kit or Cloud Admin deployment, set the generated key as:

```bash
DEVKIT4AI_DEVELOPER_KEY=dk_abc123XYZ-_789def456ghi012jkl345
```

## Generation Flow

1. Cloud Admin UI calls `POST /api/v1/auth/developer-keys` with optional `name` parameter
2. Backend generates key with `dk_` prefix and 32 random URL-safe characters
3. Full key is hashed with SHA-256
4. Hash and prefix (first 8 chars) are stored in the database
5. Full key is returned in response and displayed once
6. Key becomes valid immediately for API requests

## Rate Limits

Each developer account is limited to **10 active keys** at a time. Revoke unused keys before generating new ones if you reach this limit.

## Security

<Warning>
- Store the full key securely - it cannot be retrieved again
- Never commit keys to version control
- Rotate keys regularly (every 90 days recommended)
- Revoke compromised keys immediately
</Warning>

## API Reference

See the [Developer Keys API endpoint](/cloud-api/auth/developer-keys) for complete request/response details.
