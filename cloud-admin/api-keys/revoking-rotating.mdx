Revocation flows map to backend commands that deactivate hashes and emit rotation events:

- Use the forthcoming console UI (or call the REST endpoints directly) to disable keys via `DELETE /api/v1/auth/developer-keys/{key_id}` or `POST /api/v1/projects/revoke-api-key`.
- The read models update immediately, so the console reflects the new status after a rotation.
- Plan rotations alongside Starter Kit deployments by updating environment variables before removing access from the old key.
