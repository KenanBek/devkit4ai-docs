Security recommendations mirror the controls implemented in the backend:

- Keys are hashed server-side; never store the plain text value after the initial reveal.
- Rotate keys through the Cloud API or upcoming console forms so the event store tracks revocation events.
- Limit who can access the operator console where developer keys are created, since those keys unlock privileged actions.

We will document additional operational practices here as we formalize runbooks for the hosted service.
