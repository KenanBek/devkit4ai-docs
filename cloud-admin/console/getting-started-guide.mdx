The console includes a "Getting Started" section implemented in `app/console/getting-started.tsx`. It summarizes the same onboarding steps described in this documentation:

- Confirm your deployment mode is `operator` and environment variables are configured.
- Copy the default project API key into your Starter Kit `.env.local` file.
- Invite end users or teammates once the project is ready.

We will iterate on both the UI and this guide together so they continue to reflect the live product.
