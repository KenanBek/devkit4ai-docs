The console home page renders a set of quick action cards defined in `user-app/app/console/quick-actions.tsx` (exported to the Starter Kit for parity).

- Buttons link to project management, API keys, documentation, and support resources.
- Disabled states mirror the current product roadmap, signaling features that are still under construction.
- As new actions go live, this page will document their behavior so operators and developers know what to expect.
