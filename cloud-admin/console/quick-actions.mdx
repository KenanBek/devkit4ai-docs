The console home page renders a set of quick action cards defined in `user-app/app/console/quick-actions.tsx` (exported to the Starter Kit for parity).

## Available Quick Actions

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Create Project" icon="folder-plus" href="/cloud-admin/projects/creating-projects">

  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Manage API Keys" icon="key" href="/cloud-admin/api-keys/creating-project-keys">
    Generate or revoke API keys for your projects.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Configure Payments" icon="credit-card" href="/cloud-admin/payments/stripe-configuration">
    Set up Stripe integration to enable billing for your users.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="View Documentation" icon="book" href="/">
    Access guides and API reference documentation.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Payment Configuration

The **Configure Payments** action provides quick access to:

- Set up Stripe API keys (test and live mode)
- Configure webhook endpoints
- Validate credentials before going live
- View subscription and transaction data

This is the fastest path to enabling monetization for your AI-powered applications. See [Payment Management Overview](/cloud-admin/payments/overview) for the complete guide.

## Roadmap Actions

Some quick actions may show as disabled, indicating features under development:

- Disabled states mirror the current product roadmap
- Features become active as they're released
- Check the changelog for recent additions
