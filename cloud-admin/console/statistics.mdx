The Cloud Admin console dashboard at `/console` displays real-time statistics about your projects, API keys, end users, and system status. These metrics help you monitor platform usage and growth at a glance.

## Statistics Overview

The dashboard displays four primary statistics cards:

### Projects Count

Shows the total number of projects you've created. This includes both active and inactive projects.

- **Icon**: Folder icon
- **Data Source**: Fetched from `/api/v1/projects` endpoint
- **Updates**: Real-time on every page load
- **Calculation**: Count of all projects owned by your developer account

### API Keys Count

Displays the total number of API keys across all your projects. This helps you track credential distribution.

- **Icon**: Key icon
- **Data Source**: Aggregated from project API key endpoints
- **Updates**: Real-time on every page load
- **Calculation**: Sum of API keys from all projects via `/api/v1/projects/{project_id}/api-keys`

### End Users Count

Shows the total number of end users who have registered through your project applications.

- **Icon**: Users icon
- **Data Source**: Fetched from `/api/v1/users` endpoint
- **Updates**: Real-time on every page load
- **Calculation**: Count of all users associated with your projects

### Status Indicator

Displays the operational status of your account and projects.

- **Icon**: Activity icon
- **Values**: "Active", "Warning", "Error"
- **Indication**: Overall health of your developer account and projects

## Stats Card Components

Each statistics card follows a consistent design pattern:

```typescript
interface StatsCardProps {
  title: string;        // "Projects", "API Keys", "End Users"
  value: number;        // Numeric count
  description: string;  // "Total projects created"
  icon: ReactNode;      // Lucide icon component
}
```

The `StatsCard` component displays:
- Large numeric value (primary metric)
- Descriptive title
- Icon visual indicator
- Supporting description text

## Data Fetching

Statistics are fetched using server actions on every console page load:

```typescript
// Server actions used
fetchProjects()        // Returns Project[]
fetchProjectApiKeys()  // Returns ApiKey[] per project
fetchUsers()          // Returns User[] (upcoming)
```

### API Endpoints

**Projects Endpoint:**
```bash
GET /api/v1/projects
Headers:
  - Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
  - X-User-Role: developer
  - X-Developer-Key: <developer_key>
```

**API Keys Endpoint:**
```bash
GET /api/v1/projects/{project_id}/api-keys
Headers:
  - Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
  - X-User-Role: developer
  - X-Developer-Key: <developer_key>
```

**Users Endpoint:**
```bash
GET /api/v1/users
Headers:
  - Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
  - X-User-Role: developer
  - X-Developer-Key: <developer_key>
```

## Real-Time Updates

<Note>
Statistics update on every page load. No caching is currently implemented, ensuring you always see the latest data.
</Note>

The current implementation:
- Executes server actions on every request
- No client-side caching layer
- No streaming updates or WebSocket connections
- Refresh the page to see updated statistics

Future enhancements will include:
- Automatic refresh intervals
- Real-time streaming updates via Server-Sent Events
- Historical trend graphs
- Time-range filtering

## Understanding Your Metrics

### Projects Growth

Track how many projects you've created over time. A growing project count indicates:
- Active development of new applications
- Testing and experimentation
- Multiple product initiatives

### API Keys Distribution

Monitor API key count to understand:
- How many unique credentials are in circulation
- Potential security exposure surface
- Need for key rotation or consolidation

### User Adoption

End user count reflects:
- Registration rate through your applications
- Product adoption and growth
- Marketing campaign effectiveness

<Tip>
Compare your end users count across different projects to identify your most successful applications.
</Tip>

## Additional Dashboard Sections

Beyond statistics cards, the console dashboard includes:

### Getting Started Section

Displays setup guidance for new developers. Automatically hides once you've:
- Created your first project
- Generated an API key
- Deployed a project application

### Quick Actions Section

Provides one-click access to common tasks:
- Create new project
- Generate API key
- View all users
- Access documentation

### Recent Activity

<Info>
Recent activity feed is planned for a future release. It will show recent project updates, API key generation, and user registrations.
</Info>

## Design System Consistency

Statistics cards use the shared design system from the Starter Kit:

- **Typography**: Consistent font sizes and weights
- **Icons**: Lucide icon library
- **Colors**: Tailwind utility classes with dark mode support
- **Spacing**: Standardized padding and margins
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design that adapts to screen size

## Troubleshooting

### Statistics Show Zero

If all statistics show zero values:
1. Verify your developer key is correctly configured
2. Check that you're logged in with the correct account
3. Ensure projects have been created successfully
4. Review browser console for API errors

### Incorrect Counts

If statistics don't match expectations:
1. Refresh the page to fetch latest data
2. Verify RBAC permissions are correctly configured
3. Check that project associations are properly recorded
4. Review backend logs for projection errors
