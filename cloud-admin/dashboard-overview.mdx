The `/console` route renders a dashboard sourced from `user-app/app/console/page.tsx` (and mirrored in the Starter Kit for completeness):

- Stats cards pull project and API key counts via the server actions in `app/console/actions.ts`.
- Quick actions and getting started tiles link to project creation, API key management, and documentation.
- Configuration issue banners alert you to missing environment variables, matching the same readiness checks used in other modes.

As new console widgets ship, this page will expand with accurate screenshots and workflows derived directly from the code.
