After a developer registers, the backend emits the `UserWasRegistered` event and returns provisioning data (developer key, project ID, project API key) exactly as described in `CURRENT_FEATURES.md`.

- On first sign-in, `backendLoginAction` stores JWT cookies and redirects to `/console`, matching the shared server action implementation.
- The console banner surfaces configuration issues (if any) based on the deployment mode checks in `lib/deployment-mode.ts`.
- Developers can immediately copy their keys for use in the Starter Kit, keeping the documentation aligned with the real onboarding journey.
