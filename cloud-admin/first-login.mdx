After creating your developer account, your first login experience is designed to get you building quickly.

## What Happens on First Login

When you sign in for the first time:

1. **Automatic redirect to console:** You land on `/console` dashboard
2. **Credentials displayed:** Your developer key, project ID, and API key are shown
3. **Project created:** A default project is already set up for you
4. **Ready to build:** All credentials needed for the Starter Kit are available

## Dashboard Welcome Screen

Your first view of the console shows:

### Quick Stats

- **Projects:** 1 (your default project)
- **API Keys:** 1 (your default project key)
- **End Users:** 0 (no users yet)
- **Status:** Active and ready

### Getting Started Guide

A step-by-step checklist helps you:

<Steps>

    Save your developer key, project ID, and API key to a secure location
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clone the Starter Kit">

  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure environment">
    Add your credentials to the Starter Kit's `.env.local` file
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start building">

</Steps>

### Quick Actions Panel

Shortcuts to common tasks:

- **Create New Project:** Set up additional projects
- **Generate API Key:** Create more keys for your projects
- **View Documentation:** Access guides and tutorials
- **View Examples:** See sample applications

## Configuration Banner

If you see a banner at the top of the console, it indicates:

- **Missing environment variables:** Some configuration is incomplete
- **Invalid credentials:** Check that your keys are properly formatted
- **Connection issues:** Verify you can reach the Cloud API

The banner provides specific error messages to help you resolve issues quickly.

## Copying Your Credentials

<Warning>
**One-time display:** Full credentials (developer key and API keys) are shown in their entirety only when first generated. After you navigate away, only the key prefix will be visible for security.
</Warning>

### Best Practices

1. **Use a password manager:** Store credentials securely
2. **Don't commit to version control:** Never add keys to Git
3. **Use environment variables:** Keep keys out of your codebase
4. **Regenerate if compromised:** Create new keys if you suspect exposure

## What to Copy

Make sure you save these three values:

```bash
# Developer Key (starts with dk_)
DEVKIT4AI_DEVELOPER_KEY=dk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Project ID (UUID format)
DEVKIT4AI_PROJECT_ID=123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000

# Project API Key (starts with pk_)
DEVKIT4AI_PROJECT_KEY=pk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
