<Info>
Cloud Admin is available at **[devkit4ai.com/console](https://devkit4ai.com/console)** or **[vibecoding.ad/console](https://vibecoding.ad/console)**. Choose whichever domain you prefer - they offer the same functionality.
</Info>

The Cloud Admin console is your workspace for managing AI projects, generating API keys, and monitoring users. This guide walks you through creating your account and understanding the console.

## Create Your Developer Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to registration">
    Visit [devkit4ai.com/register/developer](https://devkit4ai.com/register/developer) (or use [vibecoding.ad/register/developer](https://vibecoding.ad/register/developer)).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete the registration form">
    Provide:
    - **Email address:** Use a valid email you have access to
    - **Password:** At least 8 characters with uppercase, lowercase, and a digit
    
    <Tip>
    Use a password manager to generate and store a strong password.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Automatic provisioning">
    Upon successful registration, the system automatically:
    - Creates your developer account
    - Sets up your first project
    - Generates your developer key and project API key
    
    <Check>
    These credentials are ready to use immediately - no waiting for approval.
    </Check>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify your email (optional)">
    Check your inbox for a verification email. While email verification isn't required to start building, it's recommended for account security.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## First Login

After registration, you're automatically signed in and redirected to the console dashboard.

### What You'll See

- **Dashboard overview:** Quick stats showing your projects, API keys, and users
- **Credentials panel:** Your developer key, project ID, and API key
- **Quick actions:** Shortcuts to create projects, generate keys, and view documentation
- **Getting started guide:** Step-by-step instructions for your first deployment

<Warning>
**Save your credentials immediately!** Your developer key and API keys are shown in full only once. Copy them to a secure location (like a password manager) before navigating away.
</Warning>

## Understanding Your Credentials

You receive three types of credentials:

### Developer Key

- **Format:** Starts with `dk_` followed by random characters
- **Purpose:** Authenticates you as a developer across all your projects
- **Usage:** Required in Starter Kit environment variables
- **Security:** SHA256 hashed in the database, never stored in plain text

### Project ID

- **Format:** UUID (e.g., `123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000`)
- **Purpose:** Uniquely identifies each project you create
- **Usage:** Links your Starter Kit deployment to a specific project
- **Note:** Each Starter Kit instance needs its own project ID

### Project API Key

- **Format:** Starts with `pk_` followed by random characters  
- **Purpose:** Authenticates API requests from your Starter Kit
- **Usage:** Required in Starter Kit environment variables
- **Scope:** Limited to the specific project it was created for
