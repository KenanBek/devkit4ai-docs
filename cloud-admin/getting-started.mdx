Cloud Admin runs the same Next.js codebase as the Starter Kit but in **operator** mode (`DEVKIT4AI_MODE=operator`). It is available at `https://devkit4ai.com/console` and `https://vibecoding.ad/console`.

- Access requires the `DEVKIT4AI_OPERATOR_KEY`, which is validated against the backend RBAC helpers in `devkit4ai/backend-api/app/system/auth`.
- New developer accounts are provisioned through the `/register/developer` flow, triggering the event sourcing pipeline that creates default projects and keys.
- Once authenticated, developers land in the console experience documented throughout this section.

The remaining pages break down each workflow so the docs stay aligned with what the live service delivers today.
