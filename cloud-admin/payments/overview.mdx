The Payment Management module in Cloud Admin provides a centralized dashboard for developers to configure, monitor, and manage billing for their AI-powered applications. Each project can have independent payment settings with separate test and live Stripe credentials.

## What is Payment Management?

Payment Management enables you to:

- **Configure Stripe Integration**: Set up API keys and webhooks per project
- **Monitor Subscriptions**: Track active, trialing, and cancelled subscriptions
- **View Transactions**: Audit payment history and identify failed charges
- **Test Before Launch**: Use Stripe test mode to validate your billing flow
- **Enable End-User Billing**: Allow your users to subscribe and manage their plans

## Enabling Payments for Your Project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Payment Settings">
    Navigate to **Console > Payments > Settings** or use the "Configure Payments" quick action from your dashboard.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Stripe Credentials">
    Add your Stripe API keys for test mode first. You'll need:
    - Publishable Key (starts with `pk_test_`)
    - Secret Key (starts with `sk_test_`)
    
    <Tip>Start with test mode to validate your integration before going live.</Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Webhooks">
    Copy the webhook URL from Cloud Admin and add it to your Stripe Dashboard under **Developers > Webhooks**.
    
    Your webhook URLs follow this pattern:
    - Test: `https://api.devkit4ai.com/api/v1/payments/stripe/webhooks/{project_id}/test`
    - Live: `https://api.devkit4ai.com/api/v1/payments/stripe/webhooks/{project_id}/live`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test the Integration">
    Create test subscriptions using Stripe test cards to verify your setup works correctly.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Go Live">
    Once testing is complete, add your live Stripe credentials and switch your application to production mode.
  </Step>
</Steps>
