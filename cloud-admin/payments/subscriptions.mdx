| **cancelled** | User cancelled, access until period end | ⚠️ Until period end | Retention opportunity |
| **paused** | Temporarily paused | ❌ No access | Resume when ready |
| **unpaid** | Grace period ended, no payment | ❌ No access | Requires user action |
| **incomplete** | Initial payment pending | ❌ No access | Payment required |

## Filtering Subscriptions

Use the filter controls to find specific subscriptions:

### By Status

Filter to show only subscriptions with a specific status:

- All Statuses
- Active
- Trialing
- Past Due
- Cancelled
- Paused
- Unpaid

### By Project

When managing multiple projects, filter subscriptions by project:

1. Select the project from the dropdown
2. View only that project's subscriptions
3. Or select "All Projects" for a global view

### By Date Range

Filter by subscription creation date:

- Last 7 days
- Last 30 days
- Last 90 days
- Custom range

    - User ID and email
    - Stripe Customer ID
    - Customer creation date
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Subscription Details">

## Monitoring Subscription Health

Use the subscriptions view to monitor key metrics:

### Active Rate

```
Active Rate = (active + trialing) / total_subscriptions × 100
```

A healthy application typically maintains 85%+ active rate.

### Churn Indicators

Watch for warning signs:

| Signal | Indicates | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Rising `past_due` count | Payment collection issues | Review payment failure emails |
| Spike in `cancelled` | User dissatisfaction | Review cancellation feedback |
| Many `incomplete` | Checkout friction | Check checkout flow |
| Low trial conversion | Value proposition unclear | Improve onboarding |

## How End Users Manage Subscriptions

End users manage their subscriptions through the Customer Portal in your application:

| Action | How End User Does It | What Happens |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|
| **View Status** | Dashboard subscription widget | Fetches status from Cloud API |
| **Change Plan** | Customer Portal → Change plan | Stripe handles proration |
| **Update Payment** | Customer Portal → Update payment | Stripe updates default method |
| **Cancel** | Customer Portal → Cancel | Access continues until period end |
| **View Invoices** | Customer Portal → Invoices | Downloads from Stripe |
