Project state transitions are captured by events such as `ProjectWasCreated`, `ProjectWasUpdated`, and `ProjectWasDeactivated` (see `devkit4ai/backend-api/app/features/projects`).

- Cloud Admin surfaces these lifecycle changes through read models so developers see accurate statuses in the console.
- API routes exist for toggling activity and revoking keys; the UI will expose them as forms once the console updates land.
- Documentation here will expand with timelines and best practices drawn directly from the production workflow.
