Developers can own multiple projects because the backend associates each project with a developer ID through the event store:

- The console's project list is powered by `fetchProjects()`, which pulls every project tied to the authenticated developer via `/api/v1/projects`.
- API key listings are scoped per project, matching the Cloud API routes documented under `cloud-api/projects/*`.
- As the UI grows, this page will show filters, status indicators, and lifecycle actions that remain faithful to the real implementation.
