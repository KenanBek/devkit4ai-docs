## Tabbed Interface

The project details page organizes information into four main tabs:

### Overview Tab

### Payments Tab

Configure and monitor payment processing for your project.

(((REPLACE_THIS_WITH_IMAGE: project-payments-tab-overview.png: Screenshot of Payments tab showing Stripe configuration status, mode toggle, and payment statistics)))

**Stripe Configuration Status:**

The Payments tab displays the current state of Stripe integration for your project:

- **Configured (Test Mode)**: Stripe test credentials are set up and ready for testing
- **Configured (Live Mode)**: Production credentials are active
- **Not Configured**: No Stripe credentials have been added yet

<Note>
Stripe credentials are stored per-project with separate test and live mode configurations. This allows you to test thoroughly before going live without affecting production settings.
</Note>

**Mode Toggle:**

Switch between Test and Live modes to manage different credential sets:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Test Mode"
        TK[Test API Keys]
        TW[Test Webhook Secret]
        TD[Test Data]
    end
    
    subgraph "Live Mode"
        LK[Live API Keys]
        LW[Live Webhook Secret]
        LD[Real Transactions]
    end
    
    Toggle[Mode Toggle] --> |"Test"| TK
    Toggle --> |"Live"| LK
```

- Test mode uses Stripe test API keys for development
- Live mode uses production API keys for real transactions
- Each mode has its own webhook secret for secure event processing

**Payment Statistics Cards:**

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Active Subscriptions | Number of currently active subscriptions in selected mode |
| Total Transactions | Count of all payment transactions processed |
| Revenue (MTD) | Month-to-date revenue (live mode only) |

</Tip>

**Configuring Stripe Credentials:**

1. Click "Configure Stripe" button
2. Select mode (Test or Live)
3. Enter your Stripe API keys from [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
4. Enter your webhook signing secret

## Project Statistics

The Overview tab displays real-time statistics fetched from the Cloud API:

**API Keys Count:**
```typescript
GET /api/v1/projects/{projectId}/api-keys
// Returns: Array of ApiKey objects
// Count: apiKeys.length
```

**Members Count:**
```typescript
GET /api/v1/projects/{projectId}/users
// Returns: Array of User objects
// Count: users.length
```

**Status Indicator:**
- **Active**: Project is operational and accepting requests
- **Inactive**: Project is disabled (API keys won't work)
- **Error**: Configuration or system issues detected

## Data Loading

The project details page uses React Suspense for optimal loading:

```typescript
<Suspense fallback={<LoadingSpinner />}>
  <ProjectDetailContent projectId={projectId} />
</Suspense>
```

**Loading States:**
- Initial page load shows skeleton UI
- Tab switching is instant (data pre-loaded)
- API key generation shows loading dialog
- Member list pagination shows inline loading

## Server Actions

The page uses several server actions for data fetching and mutations:

**Fetch Project:**
```typescript
fetchProject(projectId: string)
  -> GET /api/v1/projects/{projectId}
  -> Returns: Project
```

**Fetch API Keys:**
```typescript
fetchProjectApiKeys(projectId: string)
  -> GET /api/v1/projects/{projectId}/api-keys
  -> Returns: ApiKey[]
```

**Generate API Key:**
```typescript
generateApiKeyAction(projectId: string, name?: string)
  -> POST /api/v1/projects/{projectId}/api-keys
  -> Body: { name }
  -> Returns: { id, key, key_prefix, name, created_at }
```

**Delete API Key:**
```typescript
deleteApiKeyAction(projectId: string, keyId: string)
  -> DELETE /api/v1/projects/{projectId}/api-keys/{keyId}
  -> Returns: Success confirmation
```

**Fetch Members:**
```typescript
fetchProjectMembers(projectId: string, params: FilterParams)
  -> GET /api/v1/projects/{projectId}/users
  -> Query: page, limit, search, status, role
  -> Returns: { users: User[], total: number }
```

## Security and Permissions

**Developer-Scoped Access:**
- Developers can only access their own projects
- RBAC enforced via `X-Developer-Key` header
- Project ID validated against developer ownership

**Role Enforcement:**
- Project details page requires `developer` role
- `requireRole(['developer'])` enforced in layout
- Unauthorized users redirected to dashboard

**API Key Security:**
- Full keys shown only once at generation
- Key prefixes displayed for identification
- Hashed keys stored in database (SHA256)

## Navigation

**Breadcrumb Trail:**
```
Console > Projects > [Project Name]
```

**Quick Navigation:**
- Back to Projects list
- Jump to specific tab via URL hash
- Keyboard shortcuts (coming soon)

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Organize API keys with descriptive names to easily identify their purpose (e.g., "Production App", "Staging Environment").
</Tip>

**API Key Management:**
1. Name keys descriptively when generating
2. Rotate keys periodically for security
3. Delete unused keys immediately
4. Monitor "Last Used" timestamps
5. Use separate keys for different environments

**Member Management:**
1. Regularly review active members
2. Use search to locate specific users quickly
3. Monitor registration patterns for suspicious activity
4. Keep member lists organized with filters

**Project Settings:**
1. Keep project name and description up-to-date
2. Use deactivation to temporarily disable projects
3. Back up important data before deletion
4. Document configuration changes

## Troubleshooting

### Project Not Loading

If project details fail to load:
1. Verify project ID is valid UUID
2. Check developer key has access to project
3. Ensure project hasn't been deleted
4. Review browser console for API errors

### API Keys Not Displaying

If API key list is empty:
1. Generate a new key to test
2. Check API key endpoint permissions
3. Verify project is active
4. Review backend logs for errors

### Members Not Showing

If members list is empty:
1. Verify end users have registered through project app
2. Check project ID is correctly configured in app
3. Ensure member registration events are processing
4. Review projector logs for errors
