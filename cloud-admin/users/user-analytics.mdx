Analytics dashboards are on the roadmap. The current backend already captures timestamps for registrations, logins, and generation requests, so the data is available once the console layer surfaces it.

- Event stores provide an append-only history you can query for trends without mutating the underlying facts.
- Future console widgets will reuse this telemetry to plot growth metrics for developers and operators.
- This page will host those workflows once they are live, keeping documentation aligned with reality.
