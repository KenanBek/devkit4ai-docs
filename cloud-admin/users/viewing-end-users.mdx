End users register through project-mode apps, triggering the same `UserWasRegistered` and `UserWasActivated` events as developers. The read models already record project associations, so Cloud Admin will surface them once the console UI lands.

- Upcoming views will query dedicated endpoints that expose project-scoped user lists. Those endpoints will rely on the RBAC helpers in `app/system/auth/project_access.py` to ensure developers see only their own data.
- Until the UI ships, operators can inspect the backing tables directly or build internal monitors against the Cloud API.
- We will update this page with concrete instructions as soon as the official experience is available.
