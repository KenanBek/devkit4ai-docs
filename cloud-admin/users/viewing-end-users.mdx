The Cloud Admin console provides a dedicated end-user management page at `/console/users` where you can view, search, and filter all end users associated with your projects.

## Accessing End User Management

Navigate to the Users section from the console sidebar to access the end-user management interface. This page displays all end users who have registered through your project-mode applications.

## Users Table

The users table displays key information about each end user:

- **Email**: User's registered email address
- **Full Name**: Display name (if provided during registration)
- **Role**: User role (typically "end_user" for project users)
- **Status**: Active or inactive status indicator
- **Created At**: Registration timestamp
- **Actions**: Quick action menu for user management

## Search and Filtering

### Search by Email

Use the search input at the top of the page to filter users by email address. The search is case-insensitive and updates results in real-time as you type.

```typescript
// Example: Search query in action
searchQuery: "user@example.com"
```

### Filter by Status

Filter users by their account status:

- **All Users**: Show all users regardless of status
- **Active**: Show only users with active accounts
- **Inactive**: Show only deactivated users

### Filter by Role

Filter users by their role assignment:

- **All Roles**: Show users with any role
- **End User**: Show only end users (default for project users)
- **Developer**: Show only developers (if any were added to projects)

### Clear Filters

Click the "Clear Filters" button to reset all search and filter criteria to their default state.

## Pagination

Navigate through large user lists with pagination controls at the bottom of the table:

- **Previous/Next**: Navigate between pages
- **Page Indicator**: Shows current page and total pages
- **Default Page Size**: 20 users per page

## User Data Source

End users register through your deployed project-mode applications. When a user completes registration:

1. The Cloud API triggers `UserWasRegistered` and `UserWasActivated` events
2. Projectors update the read models with user data and project associations
3. The console queries `/api/v1/users` endpoint with developer-scoped access
4. RBAC helpers in `app/system/auth/project_access.py` ensure you only see users from your own projects

## API Integration

The users page fetches data from the Cloud API using server actions:

```typescript
// Server action: fetchUsers()
GET /api/v1/users
Headers:
  - Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
  - X-User-Role: developer
  - X-Developer-Key: <developer_key>

Query Parameters:
  - page: number (default: 1)
  - limit: number (default: 20)
  - search: string (optional)
  - status: "active" | "inactive" (optional)
  - role: string (optional)
```

## User Management Actions

<Note>
User activation and deactivation features are currently in development. The Actions menu in the users table will be enabled in a future release.
</Note>

Planned actions include:
- View detailed user profile
- Deactivate/reactivate user accounts
- Remove user from project
- View user activity and generation history

## Best Practices

<Tip>
Regularly review your end users list to monitor registration patterns and identify any suspicious accounts.
</Tip>

1. **Monitor Active Users**: Keep track of active vs inactive accounts to understand engagement
2. **Search Efficiently**: Use the email search to quickly locate specific users
3. **Filter by Status**: Identify inactive accounts that may need attention
4. **Project Association**: Remember that users shown are scoped to your projects only
