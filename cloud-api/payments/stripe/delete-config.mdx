## What Gets Deactivated

When you delete a Stripe configuration:

| Item | Action |
|------|--------|
| API Credentials | Marked as inactive, no longer usable |
| Webhook Secret | No longer validates incoming webhooks |
| Existing Subscriptions | **Remain active** in Stripe |
| Payment History | **Preserved** for records |

    B -->|Yes| D[Mark Config Inactive]
    D --> E[Credentials Disabled]
    E --> F[Webhooks Stop Processing]

    H[Existing Subscriptions] -.->|Unaffected| I[Still Active in Stripe]
    J[Payment History] -.->|Unaffected| K[Preserved in Database]

<Warning>
**Important:** Deleting the Stripe configuration does NOT cancel active subscriptions. Users will continue to be charged until you manually cancel subscriptions in Stripe.
</Warning>

## Reactivating Payments

To re-enable payments after deletion, create a new configuration:

  -H "Authorization: Bearer {developer_jwt}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "test_secret_key": "sk_test_..."
  }'
```
