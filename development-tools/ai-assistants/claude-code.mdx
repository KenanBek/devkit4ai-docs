Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI tool. This guide will help you set up Claude Code to build AI-powered applications with the Starter Kit.

## Prerequisites

- Active Claude subscription (Pro, Max, or API access)
- Starter Kit cloned from [GitHub](https://github.com/VibeCodingStarter/starter-kit)
- Cloud Admin account with developer credentials

## Setup

1. Install Claude Code globally:

  ```bash
  npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

2. Navigate to your Starter Kit project directory.
3. (Optional) Add the `CLAUDE.md` file below to your project.
4. Run `claude` to start.

## Create `CLAUDE.md`

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file at the root of your Starter Kit project to train Claude Code on your development standards:

````markdown
# Dev Kit for AI - Starter Kit Development

## Working relationship
- Push back on ideas when you have better suggestions - cite technical reasons
- ALWAYS ask for clarification rather than making assumptions about requirements
- NEVER make up API endpoints, environment variables, or configuration values
- Reference actual files in the codebase when explaining patterns

## Project context
- **Type**: Next.js 15.5.6 application with React 19 Server Components
- **Language**: TypeScript 5 (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.4.18 with dark mode
- **Auth**: JWT via Cloud API (https://api.vibecoding.ad)
- **Components**: Radix UI primitives, custom UI library

## Architecture principles
- Server Components by default - use "use client" only when necessary
- Server Actions for all mutations and data fetching
- TypeScript strict mode - explicit types for everything
- Cloud API integration - never direct database access
- httpOnly cookies for authentication - never localStorage
- Mobile-first responsive design with Tailwind

## Code standards
- Check existing patterns before creating new ones
- Follow component organization: ui/, generic/, project/, starter/
- Use cn() helper for conditional Tailwind classes
- Implement proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Write explicit TypeScript types - avoid `any`
- Support dark mode with dark: prefix on colors

## File structure
```
app/              # App Router pages and layouts
  actions.ts      # Server actions
  layout.tsx      # Root layout with providers
components/       # React components by category
lib/              # Core libraries and utilities
config/           # App configuration
```

## File naming
- Components: PascalCase (UserProfile.tsx, LoginForm.tsx)
- Pages: lowercase (page.tsx, layout.tsx, error.tsx)
- Utilities: kebab-case (auth-server.ts, deployment-mode.ts)
- Config: kebab-case with .config.ts suffix

## Authentication patterns
- Server-side: Use getCurrentUser() or requireAuth() from lib/auth-server.ts
- Client-side: Use useCurrentUser() or useIsAuthenticated() hooks
- Protected pages: Call requireAuth() in Server Components
- Server Actions: Get user from getCurrentUser() before mutations

## Component patterns
- Default to Server Components for better performance
- Use "use client" for hooks, event handlers, browser APIs
- Pass user data as props from Server to Client Components
- Use React.cache() for expensive server-side operations
- Implement loading and error states

## Environment variables
Required in .env.local:
```bash
DEVKIT4AI_MODE=project
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.vibecoding.ad
DEVKIT4AI_DEVELOPER_KEY=dk_...
DEVKIT4AI_PROJECT_ID=uuid
DEVKIT4AI_PROJECT_KEY=pk_...
```

## Testing requirements
- Write Vitest tests for utilities and helpers
- Write Playwright tests for critical user flows
- Test all auth flows (login, register, protected routes)
- Verify error handling and edge cases
- Run tests before committing: `npm run test`

## Git workflow
- NEVER use --no-verify when committing
- Ask about uncommitted changes before starting new work
- Create feature branches for new functionality
- Commit frequently with descriptive messages
- NEVER skip or disable pre-commit hooks
- Run linting and type checking before commits

## Do not
- Use Client Components when Server Components suffice
- Store authentication tokens in localStorage
- Make assumptions about API responses - check the docs
- Use inline styles instead of Tailwind classes
- Skip TypeScript types or use `any`
- Hardcode values that should be in config
- Create components without checking existing patterns
- Make breaking changes without discussing first
