Backend setup follows the steps in `devkit4ai/backend-api/README.md`:

- `make setup` creates a virtual environment and installs dependencies pinned in `pyproject.toml`.
- `make start-services` boots PostgreSQL and Redis via Docker, matching the infrastructure the app expects.
- `make run` launches Uvicorn with auto-reload so command handlers, projectors, and policies rebuild as you edit them.

The documentation here will expand with debugging workflows and common migrations pulled directly from the main repo.
