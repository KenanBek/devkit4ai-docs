Use the commands provided in `devkit4ai/user-app/Makefile` and `starter-kit/Makefile`:

- `make run-operator`, `make run-console`, and `make run-project` spawn the user app in each mode (ports 3000-3002).
- The Starter Kit's `npm run dev` starts the project-mode experience on port 3004, mirroring the exported configuration.
- Hot reloading relies on Turbopack, so component and layout changes appear instantly during development.
