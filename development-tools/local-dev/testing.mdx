Testing commands mirror the ones in each repository:

- Backend API: `cd devkit4ai/backend-api && make test` (or `make test-fast` / `make test-integration`). Tests rely on real services via Testcontainers, as outlined in `AGENTS.md`.
- User App: `cd devkit4ai/user-app && npm run test` for Vitest, `npm run test:e2e` for Playwright.
- Starter Kit: identical npm scripts live in the exported project so downstream developers can reuse them.

Future sections will collect troubleshooting notes for common setup issues that have surfaced in the main repo.
