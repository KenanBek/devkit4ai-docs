The `Dev Kit for AI.code-workspace` file in the monorepo configures recommended extensions and formatting defaults:

- Black and isort for Python, Prettier and ESLint for TypeScript, matching the formatting rules enforced by the project.
- Suggested extensions include Mintlify, Tailwind CSS IntelliSense, and Python tooling to mirror the development environment used internally.
- Update workspace settings sparingly to keep alignment with the standards documented in `AGENTS.md` across services.
