Cloud Admin is the operator-mode deployment of the shared Next.js codebase described in `devkit4ai/user-app/SPECS.md`.

- It enforces the **developer** role and requires the `DEVKIT4AI_OPERATOR_KEY` header so actions resolve through the RBAC policies in `devkit4ai/backend-api/app/system/auth`.
- Developers sign up here, and the backend emits the `UserWasRegistered` and `ProjectWasCreated` events to provision an initial project, API key, and developer key exactly as implemented in the event-sourced workflow.
- Console features—projects, API keys, usage dashboards—are the same capabilities surfaced in the `/console` routes documented in `CURRENT_FEATURES.md`.

The forthcoming Cloud Admin section provides setup guidance, feature tours, and operational checklists aligned with the production service.
