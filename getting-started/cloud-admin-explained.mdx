Cloud Admin is your management console for the Dev Kit for AI platform. Access it at **[devkit4ai.com/console](https://devkit4ai.com/console)** or **[vibecoding.ad/console](https://vibecoding.ad/console)** to manage everything related to your AI applications.

## What You Can Do

### Developer Registration

### Project Management

- **Create projects:** Set up multiple projects for different applications
- **View details:** See project status, creation date, and configuration
- **Update settings:** Modify project names and descriptions
- **Delete projects:** Remove projects you no longer need

### API Key Management

- **Generate keys:** Create API keys for each project
- **View credentials:** Access your developer key and project keys
- **Monitor usage:** Track when keys were last used
- **Revoke access:** Disable keys if they're compromised

### User Analytics

## Key Features

### Dashboard Overview

When you log in, you'll see:

- **Recent activity:** Latest actions and updates in your workspace
- **Quick actions:** Shortcuts to create projects, generate keys, and view users

### Console Navigation

The console is organized into clear sections:

- **Settings:** Configure your developer account preferences

### Security Features

- **Developer keys:** SHA256 hashed with "dk_" prefix

- **One-time display:** Full keys shown only once at generation
- **Key prefixes:** Stored for identification without exposing full keys

## Typical Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your account">
    Sign up at [devkit4ai.com/console](https://devkit4ai.com/console) with your email and password. Your first project is created automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get your credentials">
    Copy your developer key, project ID, and project API key from the dashboard. Store them securely.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure Starter Kit">
    Add these credentials to your Starter Kit's environment variables.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create additional projects">
    As you build more applications, create new projects and generate separate API keys for each.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor usage">
    Check the dashboard regularly to see user growth and API key usage.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Important Notes

<Warning>
**Save your keys immediately:** Developer keys and API keys are shown in full only once when generated. Copy them to a secure location (like a password manager) before leaving the page.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**One project per application:** Create a separate project for each Starter Kit deployment. This keeps your users, data, and analytics isolated.
