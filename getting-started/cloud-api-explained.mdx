The hosted Cloud API is the production deployment of the FastAPI service documented in `devkit4ai/backend-api/SPECS.md`.

- Every write flows through the event-sourced command → aggregate → event pipeline, so the behavior here mirrors the `RegisterUserCommand`, `CreateProjectCommand`, and related handlers in the codebase.
- Authentication uses JWT access tokens with 30-minute lifetimes and refresh tokens with 7-day lifetimes, matching the cookie strategy used by the Starter Kit and Cloud Admin.
- RBAC is enforced with the same header matrix (`X-User-Role`, `X-Operator-Key`, `X-Developer-Key`, `X-Project-ID`, `X-API-Key`) surfaced throughout this documentation to keep parity with production endpoints.

The Cloud API tab contains endpoint-level references sourced from the live OpenAPI document so you can rely on it for integration work.
