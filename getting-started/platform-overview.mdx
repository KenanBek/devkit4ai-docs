<Note>
Dev Kit for AI combines a hosted backend API, a customizable Next.js frontend template, and a management console so you can launch AI-powered products quickly.
</Note>

The platform provides three production-ready components:

## Starter Kit

A Next.js 15 application template that serves as your customer-facing product:

- **What it is:** Open-source Next.js app with React 19, Tailwind CSS, and dark mode
- **What you do:** Clone it from GitHub, customize the UI, and deploy to your hosting
- **How it connects:** Uses environment variables to authenticate with the Cloud API
- **Key features:** User authentication, dashboards, AI generation UI, responsive design

## Cloud Admin

A web console where you manage your projects and users:

- **What it is:** Hosted management interface at [devkit4ai.com/console](https://devkit4ai.com/console) or [vibecoding.ad/console](https://vibecoding.ad/console)
- **What you do:** Register your developer account, create projects, generate API keys
- **What you get:** Developer keys, project IDs, API keys needed to configure your Starter Kit
- **Key features:** Project management, API key generation, user analytics, quick actions

## Cloud API

A hosted backend service that powers your application:

- **What it is:** Production-ready FastAPI service with authentication and AI features
- **What you do:** Connect your Starter Kit using the credentials from Cloud Admin
- **What it provides:** User authentication, role-based access, AI generation, project management
- **Key features:** JWT authentication, multi-tenant architecture, AI image generation, secure API endpoints
