<Note>
Dev Kit for AI combines a FastAPI backend, a multi-mode Next.js frontend, and hosted cloud services so you can launch AI-powered products quickly.
</Note>

The platform ships with three production-ready building blocks:

- **Starter Kit:** A project-mode Next.js app that end users interact with, exported from the private `user-app` codebase.
- **Cloud Admin:** The operator-mode deployment that developers use to manage projects, API keys, and end users.
- **Cloud API:** A hosted FastAPI service that delivers authentication, project management, and AI generation endpoints.

All components share the same multi-tenant event-sourced backend model described in `devkit4ai/backend-api/SPECS.md`, ensuring the documentation here matches the live implementation.

Further guidance on each component appears in the linked pages across this section.
