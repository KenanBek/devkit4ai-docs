## Key Concepts

### Environment Configuration

The Starter Kit validates your environment variables on startup:

- `DEVKIT4AI_MODE`: Set to "project" for production apps
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: Points to the Cloud API (https://api.vibecoding.ad)
- `DEVKIT4AI_DEVELOPER_KEY`: Your developer key from Cloud Admin
- `DEVKIT4AI_PROJECT_ID`: Your project's unique identifier
- `DEVKIT4AI_PROJECT_KEY`: API key for your specific project

If any configuration is missing or invalid, you'll see a banner at the top of your app with specific error messages.

### Authentication Flow

All authentication happens through the Cloud API:

1. User submits login/registration form
2. Starter Kit sends request to Cloud API
3. Cloud API validates credentials and returns JWT tokens
4. Tokens are stored in secure httpOnly cookies
5. Subsequent requests include tokens for authentication

### Customization Options

- **Branding:** Update logo, colors, and typography in config files
- **Pages:** Add new pages using Next.js App Router conventions
- **Components:** Modify existing or create new React components
- **Styling:** Customize Tailwind theme in tailwind.config.ts
- **Features:** Add custom AI features using the Cloud API
