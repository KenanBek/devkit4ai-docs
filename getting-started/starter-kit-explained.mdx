The Starter Kit is the open-source export of the project-mode `user-app` described in `devkit4ai/user-app/SPECS.md`.

- It runs in **project** deployment mode only and expects the developer, project, and API keys you generate in Cloud Admin.
- Authentication uses the shared JWT cookies (`devkit4ai-token`, `devkit4ai-refresh-token`) managed by the Cloud API.
- Example pages, dashboards, and UI primitives mirror the components listed in `starter-kit/SPECS.md`, so what you deploy matches the documented behavior here.

Upcoming sections dive into installation, configuration, feature walkthroughs, and customization guidance tailored to the exported codebase.
