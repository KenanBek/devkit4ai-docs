<Note>
Dev Kit for AI helps developers launch SaaS-ready AI products by combining a hosted event-sourced backend, a multi-mode Next.js frontend, and a production-ready Starter Kit.
</Note>

## Build Faster With Three Pillars

Dev Kit for AI ships the same stack we use internally:

- **Starter Kit** — Project-mode Next.js application that end users interact with. It is exported from the private `user-app` service and already wired to the hosted Cloud API.
- **Cloud Admin** — Operator-mode deployment that developers use to register, manage projects, and issue API keys. It runs the same codebase with different configuration and RBAC.
- **Cloud API** — FastAPI backend that persists events, enforces RBAC, and exposes generation, project, and auth endpoints.

Each guide in this documentation maps directly to features implemented in `devkit4ai/` so you can trust what you read matches what you deploy.
