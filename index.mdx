## Three Core Components

Dev Kit for AI ships the same stack we use internally:

- **Starter Kit** — Next.js application template for building your customer-facing AI product. Clone it, customize it, and deploy it as your own.
- **Cloud Admin** — Web console where you manage projects, API keys, and users. Access it at [devkit4ai.com/console](https://devkit4ai.com/console) or [vibecoding.ad/console](https://vibecoding.ad/console).
- **Cloud API** — Hosted backend API that handles authentication, authorization, and AI generation endpoints.

Each guide in this documentation maps directly to features implemented in the platform so you can trust what you read matches what you deploy.
