<Info>
You need a GitHub account, Node.js 19 or later, and access to the hosted Cloud Admin (`https://devkit4ai.com/console` or `https://vibecoding.ad/console`). Everything else is provided for you.
</Info>

## Before you begin

- Make sure you can sign in to Cloud Admin. New developer accounts can be created at `/register/developer` on either domain.
- Confirm that Docker is available if you plan to run the backend locally later. The quickstart uses the hosted Cloud API, so Docker is optional.
- Install `make` (or be ready to use the equivalent npm scripts) to match the commands referenced in the Starter Kit repository.

## Launch in Five Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a developer workspace">
    Visit `https://devkit4ai.com/register/developer` (or the `vibecoding.ad` equivalent) and complete the registration flow. The event-sourced backend automatically provisions your developer role, default project, and API credentials as soon as the confirmation succeeds.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collect your credentials">
    After signing in, open the Console dashboard. Copy the generated **developer key**, **project ID**, and **project API key**. These values are stored securely in the backend as hashed secrets and surface once in the UI, so save them to your password manager.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clone and install the Starter Kit">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VibeCodingStarter/starter-kit.git
    cd starter-kit
    make install   # or npm install
    ```
    The repo mirrors the `user-app` project-mode build and expects Node.js 19+ with Turbopack.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure environment variables">
    Create `.env.local` (or update the existing example) with the credentials you gathered:

    ```bash
    DEVKIT4AI_MODE=project
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.vibecoding.ad
    DEVKIT4AI_DEVELOPER_KEY=dk_your_developer_key
    DEVKIT4AI_PROJECT_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
    DEVKIT4AI_PROJECT_KEY=pk_your_project_key
    ```

    The `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` should match the region of the hosted Cloud API you are targeting.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the project-mode app">
    ```bash
    make dev   # boots npm run dev with Turbopack on port 3004
    ```
    Sign in using the same credentials you created in Cloud Admin. You will land on `/dashboard`, which confirms the project-mode flow is using the hosted Cloud API successfully.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify the connection

Use the generated tokens to call the Cloud API directly. This confirms your headers and keys are valid.

```bash
curl https://api.vibecoding.ad/api/v1/health \
  -H "X-User-Role: end_user" \
  -H "X-Developer-Key: dk_your_developer_key" \
  -H "X-Project-ID: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" \
  -H "X-API-Key: pk_your_project_key"
```

You should receive a JSON payload indicating the service status. Any authentication errors mean an environment variable is missing or mis-typed.
