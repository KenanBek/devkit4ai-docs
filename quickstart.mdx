**Goal:** In 15 minutes you'll have a working AI SaaS application connected to the hosted Cloud API.
</Check>

## What You'll Build

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- ✅ A developer account with Cloud Admin access
- ✅ A local Starter Kit connected to the Cloud API
- ✅ Working authentication and user dashboard
- ✅ AI generation endpoints ready to use

**Time required:** 15-20 minutes

<Info>
**Prerequisites:** Node.js 19 or later, a GitHub account, and access to the hosted Cloud Admin at [devkit4ai.com/console](https://devkit4ai.com/console) or [vibecoding.ad/console](https://vibecoding.ad/console).
</Info>

## Launch in Five Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a developer workspace">
    Visit [devkit4ai.com/register/developer](https://devkit4ai.com/register/developer) (or the [vibecoding.ad](https://vibecoding.ad/register/developer) equivalent) and complete the registration flow. The backend automatically provisions your developer account, default project, and API credentials as soon as the confirmation succeeds.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collect your credentials">
    After signing in, open the Console dashboard. Copy the generated **developer key**, **project ID**, and **project API key**. These values are stored securely in the backend as hashed secrets and surface once in the UI, so save them to your password manager.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Clone and install the Starter Kit">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VibeCodingStarter/starter-kit.git
    cd starter-kit
    make install   # or npm install
    ```
    The Starter Kit is built with Next.js 15 and requires Node.js 19+ with Turbopack.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure environment variables">
    Create `.env.local` (or update the existing example) with the credentials you gathered:

    ```bash
    DEVKIT4AI_MODE=project
    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.vibecoding.ad
    DEVKIT4AI_DEVELOPER_KEY=dk_your_developer_key
    DEVKIT4AI_PROJECT_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
    DEVKIT4AI_PROJECT_KEY=pk_your_project_key
    ```

    The `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` should match the region of the hosted Cloud API you are targeting.
    
    <Warning>
    **Common mistakes:**
    - Using quotes around values (remove them)
    - Wrong PROJECT_ID format (must be a valid UUID)
    - Mixing up developer key and project key
    - Incorrect API URL (check for https:// and no trailing slash)
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the development server">
    ```bash
    make dev   # boots npm run dev with Turbopack on port 3004
    ```
    Sign in using the same credentials you created in Cloud Admin. You will land on `/dashboard`, which confirms your app is connected to the hosted Cloud API successfully.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify Your Setup

Use the Cloud API health check to confirm your configuration is correct:

```bash
curl https://api.vibecoding.ad/api/v1/health \
  -H "X-User-Role: end_user" \
  -H "X-Developer-Key: dk_your_developer_key" \
  -H "X-Project-ID: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000" \
  -H "X-API-Key: pk_your_project_key"
```

You should receive a JSON payload indicating the service status. Any authentication errors mean an environment variable is missing or mis-typed.

## ✅ Success Checklist

You're ready to customize when:
- [ ] You can sign in at `localhost:3004/login`
- [ ] Dashboard loads without configuration errors
- [ ] Health check curl command returns `{"status": "healthy"}`
- [ ] You see your project in the Cloud Admin console

<Tip>
**What you learned:** You've successfully set up a developer account, cloned the Starter Kit, connected it to the Cloud API, and verified the integration. You now have a production-ready foundation for building AI features.
