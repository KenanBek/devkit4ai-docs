The platform implements Command Query Responsibility Segregation on top of its event store:

- **Commands** execute domain logic through aggregates and append events (e.g., `RegisterUserCommand`, `CreateProjectCommand`).
- **Queries** consume projector-built tables (users, projects, API keys) so reads stay fast and isolated from write contention.
- **Policies** react to events asynchronously, enabling side effects (emails, storage uploads) without blocking command execution.

These concepts align with the code documented in `devkit4ai/backend-api/SPECS.md` and the usage patterns visible in the user-app and Starter Kit.
