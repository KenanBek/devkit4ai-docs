The backend API persists all state transitions as events (see `devkit4ai/backend-api/app/system/events`). Key points:

- Commands append events via aggregates (e.g., `UserActions`, `ProjectActions`), raising facts such as `UserWasRegistered` and `ProjectWasCreated`.
- Events live in PostgreSQL tables (`event_store`, `event_streams`) with optimistic concurrency to prevent conflicting writes.
- Projectors build read models for fast queries without mutating the original events, keeping the system audit-friendly.
