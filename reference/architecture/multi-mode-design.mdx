Dev Kit for AI uses environment-driven mode selection handled by `lib/deployment-mode.ts` in the user app and Starter Kit:

- `operator` mode powers Cloud Admin and requires the `DEVKIT4AI_OPERATOR_KEY` header, exposing platform-level tooling.
- `console` mode targets developers and uses `DEVKIT4AI_DEVELOPER_KEY` to authorize project management routes.
- `project` mode serves end users, scoping requests with developer, project, and API keys.

The backend reads these headers to enforce RBAC, ensuring documentation and implementation stay in sync.
