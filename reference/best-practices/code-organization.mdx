- Follow the feature folder conventions in `devkit4ai/backend-api/app/features` and `devkit4ai/user-app/app` when adding functionality.
- Avoid duplicating logic; reuse helpers from `lib/` or `app/system` where available.
- Keep documentation changes in lockstep with code updates to maintain parity across Starter Kit exports.
