- Keep secrets out of the repo; rely on environment managers as noted in the configuration reference.
- Respect RBAC headers when calling the Cloud API so the backend can enforce permissions.
- Hash any new credentials using the same utilities the backend uses (SHA-256 for keys, bcrypt for passwords) to stay consistent with existing tables.
