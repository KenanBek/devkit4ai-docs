- Use Testcontainers for integration tests so databases and Redis match production, as mandated in project `AGENTS.md` files.
- Prefer end-to-end flows (Vitest + Playwright) when touching authentication or multi-mode features.
- Keep fixtures aligned with real Cloud API responses to avoid drift between tests and live services.
