`components/generic/*` hosts reusable sections such as hero blocks, pricing cards, and navigation aids:

- These components appear on the marketing homepage (`app/page.tsx`) and example galleries.
- They rely on the same Tailwind utility helpers and analytics hooks as the rest of the app.
- Customize them by adjusting props or cloning them into project-specific directories while keeping the underlying patterns intact.
