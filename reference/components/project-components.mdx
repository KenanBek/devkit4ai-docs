`components/project/*` includes the header, footer, pricing modules, and other scaffolding tailored to project-mode apps:

- Header links adapt to deployment mode via `useDeploymentMode()`.
- The footer pulls link groups from `config/app.config.ts` so documentation updates propagate automatically.
- Pricing components demonstrate how to build marketing sections while reusing the shared design system.
