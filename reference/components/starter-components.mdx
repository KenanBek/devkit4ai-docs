`components/starter/*` powers the marketing homepage and onboarding experience in both the user-app and the exported Starter Kit:

- Sections like `LocalOnboardingHero`, `LocalSetupGuide`, and `FeaturePreview` showcase how to assemble longer-form landing pages.
- Components are server-compatible and accept props for copy, imagery, and call-to-action links.
- Customize them to match your product while preserving the responsive layouts tested in production.
