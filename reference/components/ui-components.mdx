`components/ui/*` contains reusable primitives built with Radix and class-variance-authority:

- Buttons, inputs, dropdowns, tabs, tables, and other core building blocks share the same API across user-app and Starter Kit.
- Variants follow Tailwind utility conventions so you can extend them without rewriting styles.
- Components export `forwardRef` wrappers to maintain accessibility and composition.

Use this page as the canonical index for the primitives shipped with each release.
