Mode selection depends on `DEVKIT4AI_MODE`:

- **operator**: Cloud Admin. Requires `DEVKIT4AI_OPERATOR_KEY`. Surfaces developer onboarding tools.
- **console**: Developer workspace. Requires `DEVKIT4AI_DEVELOPER_KEY` and unlocks project and API key management.
- **project**: End-user apps (Starter Kit). Requires developer key, project ID, and project API key.

All modes rely on `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to communicate with the Cloud API, and each sends the appropriate headers enforced by `app/system/auth/rbac.py`.
