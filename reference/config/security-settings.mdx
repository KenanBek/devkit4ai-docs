Security practices are consistent across services:

- JWT access tokens (30 minutes) and refresh tokens (7 days) are stored in httpOnly cookies with secure flags in production.
- Developer and project keys are hashed with SHA-256 and only revealed once, matching the backend implementation.
- Optional S3 storage and Redis credentials are loaded from environment variables so secrets never live in the repository.

We will extend this page with hardening guides as new security features roll out.
