The Starter Kit inherits multi-tenancy from the backend event store:

- Every authenticated request includes the project ID and API key headers that the backend projectors expect.
- Read models in the Cloud API scope responses by project, so your UI receives only the data associated with the keys in use.
- When extending functionality, continue emitting events and projecting read models per the guidance in `devkit4ai/backend-api/SPECS.md` to preserve isolation.

We will back this page with diagrams and database examples sourced directly from the production schema.
