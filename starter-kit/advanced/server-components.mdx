The Starter Kit inherits the server-first philosophy from `devkit4ai/user-app`:

- Routes in `app/` render as Server Components by default—`"use client"` appears only where interactive state is required.
- Server Actions handle authentication, redirects, and API calls so you avoid duplicating logic in the browser.
- React's `cache()` utility wraps expensive fetches (`hydrateDeploymentMode`, `getCurrentUser`) exactly as seen in the private repo.

This page will showcase deeper patterns once we publish battle-tested examples from production projects.
