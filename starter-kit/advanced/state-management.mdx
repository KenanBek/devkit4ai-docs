The template keeps client-side state light:

- Authentication and deployment data flow through `AuthProvider` and `DeploymentModeProvider`, which match the contexts documented in `starter-kit/lib/auth-context.tsx`.
- Persistent UI state (theme selection, provisioning bundle) uses cookies instead of third-party stores, mirroring the upstream implementation.
- When you need additional client state, reuse the existing providers or introduce scoped contexts so you stay aligned with the architecture described in `CURRENT_FEATURES.md`.

We will expand this page with examples that demonstrate integrating external stores without breaking the default patterns.
