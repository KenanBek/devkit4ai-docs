Authentication mirrors the backend specification in `devkit4ai/backend-api/SPECS.md`:

- Login returns an access token (30-minute expiry) and optional refresh token (7-day expiry).
- Tokens are stored in httpOnly cookies (`devkit4ai-token`, `devkit4ai-refresh-token`) via `storeTokensInCookies` inside the shared server actions.
- Automatic refresh is handled by the `/api/v1/auth/refresh` endpoint and the `refreshAccessToken` helper invoked by the Cloud Admin and Starter Kit flows.

The documentation here will expand with diagrams and troubleshooting guidance that stay aligned with the production services.
