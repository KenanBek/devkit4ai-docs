The Starter Kit reuses the shared server actions defined in `starter-kit/app/actions.ts`:

- `backendLoginAction` posts to `/api/v1/auth/login`, stores JWT cookies, and redirects based on the resolved role.
- Registration actions remain available for compatibility but, in project mode, redirect users to Cloud Admin for developer sign-up.
- Error handling and rate-limit messaging mirror the server action implementation, so UI messaging aligns with backend behavior.

Upcoming sections document role handling, JWT lifetimes, and guarded routes that depend on these flows.
