To connect a cloned Starter Kit to your workspace:

1. Sign in to Cloud Admin (operator-mode deployment) and locate your developer key, default project, and project API key.
2. Copy the values into `.env.local` per the variables listed in the Environment Configuration page.
3. Restart the dev server so `hydrateDeploymentMode()` re-reads the secrets and exposes the correct headers (`X-Developer-Key`, `X-Project-ID`, `X-API-Key`).

All outbound requests from server actions and client fetch helpers will then authenticate against the Cloud API exactly as implemented in the shared `lib/deployment-mode.ts` utilities.
