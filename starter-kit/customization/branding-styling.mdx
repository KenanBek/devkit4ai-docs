Branding updates follow the same conventions as the private `user-app`:

- Tailwind configuration lives in `tailwind.config.ts`, matching the utilities referenced throughout the exported components.
- Global theming is controlled by `components/project/header.tsx`, `components/project/footer.tsx`, and `config/app.config.ts`, so color and copy changes stay centralized.
- Dark mode behavior continues to rely on `next-themes` and the `ThemeProvider` defined in `app/layout.tsx`.

This page will grow with copy-and-paste snippets that respect the code structure already in the repository.
