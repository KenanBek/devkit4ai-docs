The `components/` directory mirrors the structure in the private `user-app`:

- `components/ui/*` wraps Radix primitives with Tailwind variants for buttons, inputs, sheets, tables, and more.
- `components/generic/*` provides marketing and layout blocks used across the example pages.
- `components/project/*` contains header, footer, and pricing components tailored to the project-mode experience.

Customization guidance here will include extension tips that remain compatible with the shared class-variance-authority patterns already in the repository.
