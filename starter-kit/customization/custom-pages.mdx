New pages can follow the patterns already present under `app/`:

- Server Components by default; opt into `"use client"` only when you need browser APIs, matching the guidance in `starter-kit/SPECS.md`.
- Reuse shared layouts (e.g., `(auth)/layout.tsx`) to pick up consistent headers, footers, and providers.
- When wiring server actions, lean on the established `encodedRedirect` helpers and timeout handling showcased in `app/actions.ts`.

We will add concrete tutorials here that stay synchronized with the codebase as new examples ship.
