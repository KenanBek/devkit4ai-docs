Theme handling matches the upstream implementation:

- `ThemeProvider` from `next-themes` is initialized in `app/layout.tsx` with `attribute="class"` so Tailwind's `dark:` modifiers behave reliably.
- The header includes a `ThemeSwitcher` component that persists the selection across sessions using the same storage logic as the private repo.
- System defaults and transitions are configured exactly as described in `starter-kit/SPECS.md` to minimize divergence between documentation and code.

Future updates will add recipes for introducing additional palettes without breaking these defaults.
