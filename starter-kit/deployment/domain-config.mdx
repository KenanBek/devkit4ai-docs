Domain setup depends on your hosting provider, but the requirements stay consistent:

- Serve the app over HTTPS so the httpOnly authentication cookies remain secure, matching the expectations codified in `lib/auth-server.ts`.
- Update any environment variables (such as `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`, if you introduce one) in both the deployment platform and the App Router metadata for accurate links.
- Coordinate DNS records (A, CNAME, or ALIAS) with the guidance from your platform—Vercel, for example, exposes automated certificate management that works well with the Starter Kit.

We will expand this page with provider-specific instructions to keep it tightly coupled to real-world deployments.
