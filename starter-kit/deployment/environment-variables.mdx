Deployment environments must define the same keys validated by `hydrateDeploymentMode()`:

- `DEVKIT4AI_MODE=project`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
- `DEVKIT4AI_DEVELOPER_KEY`
- `DEVKIT4AI_PROJECT_ID`
- `DEVKIT4AI_PROJECT_KEY`

For hosted platforms, inject these values through the provider's secrets manager so they are not committed to the repository. The runtime checks in `lib/deployment-mode.ts` will surface clear error banners if anything is missing, making it easy to verify that production matches local development.
