The Starter Kit is a standard Next.js 15 application, so it deploys anywhere that supports Node.js 18+ or containerized workloads:

- Vercel offers first-class support and mirrors the setup used for our internal previews.
- Render, Fly.io, and traditional container platforms work by running `npm run start` after setting the required environment variables.
- Docker images can reuse the `Dockerfile.dev` scaffold in the repository as a starting point.

We will provide provider-specific walkthroughs here as we document production-ready configurations aligned with the live service.
