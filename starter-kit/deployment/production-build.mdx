Production builds use the same commands documented in the repository:

- Run `npm run build` (or `make verify`) to compile the Next.js app with the configuration exported from `next.config.ts`.
- Start the server with `npm run start`, which honors the project-mode environment variables already covered in this docs section.
- The build output relies on Turbopack during development but falls back to the stable Next.js compiler for production, matching the upstream configuration.

Additional guidance on CI/CD pipelines will land here as we share the exact workflows used for the hosted offering.
