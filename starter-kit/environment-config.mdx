Project mode expects the same variables defined in `starter-kit/SPECS.md` and enforced by `lib/deployment-mode.ts`:

- `DEVKIT4AI_MODE` → must be `project` to unlock the end-user flows.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` → base URL of the hosted Cloud API (default `https://api.vibecoding.ad`).
- `DEVKIT4AI_DEVELOPER_KEY`, `DEVKIT4AI_PROJECT_ID`, `DEVKIT4AI_PROJECT_KEY` → issued by Cloud Admin and validated as part of the hydration routine.

The deployment mode helper will surface warning or error banners if any values are missing or improperly formatted, matching the runtime checks inside the shipped codebase.
