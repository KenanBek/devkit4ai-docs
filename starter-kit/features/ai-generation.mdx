The Cloud API exposes the `/api/v1/generation/*` endpoints described in `cloud-api/generation/*.mdx`. The exported Starter Kit does not yet ship a first-party UI for queueing generations, but the codebase already includes the plumbing you need:

- Authenticated requests automatically attach the `end_user` headers required by the event-sourced backend.
- File storage configuration (S3 or local) follows the same feature flags outlined in `devkit4ai/backend-api/SPECS.md`.
- Example integration patterns will land here as we document a reference implementation that stays faithful to the production backend.

Until then, treat this page as the staging area for accurate, code-backed guidance rather than speculative UI walkthroughs.
