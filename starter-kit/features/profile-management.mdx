The Starter Kit currently surfaces profile-related buttons on the `/dashboard` page, but they are intentionally disabled placeholders. This mirrors the status of the upstream `user-app`, where profile editing is slated for a future milestone.

- You can hook these actions into custom routes by reusing the JWT-backed fetch utilities already present in `lib/auth-server.ts`.
- Any new endpoints should follow the event-sourced command pattern in the backend so changes flow through aggregates and projectors.
- Documentation here will expand with concrete recipes as soon as the corresponding backend capabilities ship.

Until then, use this page as a staging note that keeps the docs aligned with the actual codebase.
