The `/dashboard` route in `starter-kit/app/dashboard/page.tsx` renders a role-aware landing page that matches the private `user-app` implementation:

- `requireAuth()` enforces login before rendering, guaranteeing parity with production deployments.
- Section visibility adapts to the authenticated user role, surfacing Cloud Admin links for developers while keeping operator tools behind disabled actions.
- Call-to-action buttons route to `/console` or sign-out flows that reuse the shared server actions.

Upcoming revisions will document recommended ways to extend the dashboard for project-specific metrics while staying aligned with the core components.
