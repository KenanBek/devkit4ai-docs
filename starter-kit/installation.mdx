Follow the same workflow used internally when exporting the project-mode `user-app`:

1. Clone the public repository at `https://github.com/VibeCodingStarter/starter-kit`.
2. Install Node.js 19+ and run `make install` or `npm install`, mirroring the commands listed in `starter-kit/README.md`.
3. Verify the Turbopack development server with `npm run dev`, which boots on port 3004 by default per the shared Makefile.

Additional setup details—environment variables, Cloud API connectivity, and mode validation—are documented in the following pages.
