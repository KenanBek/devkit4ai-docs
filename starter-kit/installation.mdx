## Clone the Repository

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone from GitHub">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VibeCodingStarter/starter-kit.git

    ```
    This downloads the complete Starter Kit template to your local machine.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    ```bash

    This installs all required packages including Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and UI components.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify installation">
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The development server starts on port 3004. Visit `http://localhost:3004` to see the default homepage.
