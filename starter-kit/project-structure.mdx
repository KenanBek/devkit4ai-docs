The Starter Kit mirrors the layout described in `starter-kit/SPECS.md` and matches the `user-app` directories in the private repo:

- `app/`: App Router routes including `/dashboard`, `/login`, `/start`, and the example galleries.
- `components/`: UI primitives (Radix-based), project chrome, and marketing sections identical to their counterparts in `devkit4ai/user-app`.
- `lib/`: Deployment mode hydration, authentication helpers, provisioning store, and utility functions.
- `config/`: Mode-aware app metadata surfaced in the header and footer.
- `tests/`: Vitest integration specs and Playwright E2E scaffolding that reflect the actual project-mode behavior.

This structure is intentionally aligned with the source repository so documentation can point to concrete implementations.
