Clone `https://github.com/VibeCodingStarter/starter-kit` and install dependencies with `make install` or `npm install`. This mirrors the workflow the internal team uses when exporting the project-mode `user-app`.

- Run `npm run dev` to verify the development server boots and the deployment banner confirms configuration readiness.
- Keep the repository tied to upstream releases so you can pull improvements that stay aligned with these docs.
- The next step walks through wiring the project to your Cloud Admin workspace.
