Now that your environment is ready, let's get the Starter Kit running locally.

## Clone the Repository

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone from GitHub">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/VibeCodingStarter/starter-kit.git
    cd starter-kit
    ```
    
    This downloads the complete Next.js template with all pre-built features.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Using make (recommended):
    ```bash
    make install
    ```
    
    Or using npm directly:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
    <Info>
    Installation takes 1-3 minutes depending on your internet speed. The package manager downloads Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and all UI components.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start the development server">
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    
    The server starts on port 3004. You'll see output like:
    ```
    ▲ Next.js 15.5.6
    - Local:        http://localhost:3004
    - Environments: .env.local
    
    ✓ Ready in 2.3s
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open in your browser">
    Visit `http://localhost:3004`
    
    You should see:
    - The Starter Kit homepage
    - An amber configuration banner at the top
    - Navigation menu and theme toggle
    
    <Warning>
    **Configuration errors expected:** The banner appears because environment variables aren't set yet. This is normal - we'll fix it in the next step.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verify the Installation

### Check the Development Server

Make sure these work:

```bash
# Homepage loads
curl http://localhost:3004

# Health check works (will fail without env vars)
curl http://localhost:3004/api/health
```

### Explore the Interface

Browse through:

1. **Homepage:** See the marketing template
2. **Navigation:** Try the mobile menu
3. **Theme toggle:** Switch between light/dark mode
4. **Example pages:** Click "All examples" to see templates
5. **Login page:** Visit `/login` to see the auth form

<Tip>
Don't try to log in yet - we need to configure environment variables first!
</Tip>

## Understanding the Configuration Banner

The amber banner shows configuration issues:

**Current errors you'll see:**
- ❌ `DEVKIT4AI_DEVELOPER_KEY` is missing
- ❌ `DEVKIT4AI_PROJECT_ID` is missing
- ❌ `DEVKIT4AI_PROJECT_KEY` is missing
- ❌ `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is not set

This is expected! The Starter Kit validates environment variables on startup to help you catch configuration problems early.
