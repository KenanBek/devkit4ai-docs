Reuse the guidance from `starter-kit/environment-config.mdx` to populate `.env.local` with your developer key, project ID, and project API key.

- Restart the dev server so `hydrateDeploymentMode()` reads the values and attaches the correct headers.
- Visit `/dashboard` to confirm authentication works end-to-end. The page should display your developer email and role pulled from `/api/v1/auth/me`.
- Check the console banner for warnings about missing configuration; resolve them before proceeding to customization.
