Follow the customization guidance already documented:

- Update `config/app.config.ts` for navigation labels and logos.
- Tweak Tailwind tokens or component variants in `components/ui` to adjust branding.
- Add or modify routes under `app/` using the server-component-first approach outlined in `starter-kit/customization/custom-pages.mdx`.

These changes give you a branded experience while keeping the code aligned with upstream conventions.
