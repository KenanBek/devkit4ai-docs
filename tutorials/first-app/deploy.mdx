Deploy using the same commands described in the deployment section:

- Run `npm run build` locally or in CI to validate the production bundle.
- Choose a hosting provider (Vercel, Render, Fly.io, or a container platform) and set the required environment variables.
- Point your custom domain at the deployment and confirm that secure cookies work end-to-end by logging in via the hosted site.

Future iterations will include provider-specific walkthroughs and automation scripts that mirror our production setup.
