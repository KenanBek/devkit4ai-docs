This tutorial chains together steps already covered in the Getting Started and Starter Kit sections:

- Install Node.js 19+, pnpm or npm, and the Mintlify CLI if you plan to preview docs locally.
- Provision a developer account and keys through Cloud Admin so the Starter Kit can authenticate against the Cloud API.
- Confirm Docker is available if you intend to run the backend locally, matching the workflows in `devkit4ai/README.md`.

Subsequent steps reuse this foundation to build, configure, and deploy your app.
