Analytics platforms (PostHog, Amplitude, Vercel Analytics) can complement the built-in telemetry:

- The Starter Kit already includes Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights; extend those integrations or swap them for your preferred tool.
- Emit custom events in client components that already run in the browser (e.g., marketing pages) to avoid hydration mismatches.
- We will provide instrumentation examples as we solidify the analytics stack used in production.
