The Cloud API currently integrates with Replicate for image generation (see `devkit4ai/backend-api/app/integrations/replicate_ai.py`). To plug in other providers:

- Implement new policies or services that emit the same events so projectors stay unchanged.
- Keep configuration in environment variables (`REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`, etc.) so deployments remain configurable.
- We will publish end-to-end instructions here once additional providers are supported in production.
