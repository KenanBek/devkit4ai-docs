Email notifications tie in naturally with the policy layer in the backend:

- The placeholder `SendWelcomeEmailWhenUserActivated` policy already exists; replace the logger with calls to your email provider (SES, SendGrid, Resend).
- Treat emails as side effects triggered by events so they remain idempotent and replay-safe.
- This page will host detailed steps and code samples once we finalize the reference integration.
