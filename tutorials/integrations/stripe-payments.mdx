Stripe integration is a common request, and the event-sourced architecture makes it straightforward to track billing events:

- Use webhooks to emit domain events when payments succeed or fail, keeping the event store the single source of truth.
- Securely store Stripe keys alongside existing environment variables; the deployment tooling already expects secrets to be managed outside the repository.
- We will publish a reference implementation here once the official integration ships.
