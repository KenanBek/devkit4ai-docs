This tutorial will document how to wire the `/api/v1/generation/*` endpoints into a custom UI. The backend already supports uploads, asynchronous processing, and visibility toggles; the Starter Kit will provide a reference interface here.

- Ensure end users authenticate through the project-mode app so requests include the correct headers.
- Store generation assets using the same storage abstraction (`S3` or local) described in `backend-api/SPECS.md`.
- Track status updates via the event store so dashboards stay accurate.
