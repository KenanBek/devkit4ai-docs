This scenario shows how to extend login and registration without breaking compatibility:

- Start with the shared server actions (`backendLoginAction`, `backendRegisterAction`) so JWT handling stays consistent.
- Add custom validation or multi-factor checks in wrappers that still call the Cloud API endpoints described in `cloud-api/auth/*`.
- Update UI states using the existing form components (`components/form-message`, `components/submit-button`) to keep UX consistent.
